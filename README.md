Qreator is a web application designed to provide users with an intuitive interface for converting URLs, phone numbers, and email addresses into QR codes. The project was developed using XZing and SkiaSharp, two powerful libraries for generating and rendering QR codes. XZing is utilized to encode the data into the QR code format, while SkiaSharp is used for rendering the QR code images on the web application.

The applicationâ€™s design focuses on user-friendliness, enabling users to generate QR codes effortlessly by simply entering the desired information and clicking a button. This streamlined process ensures a seamless experience, catering to both novice and advanced users. Through this project, I leveraged the capabilities of XZing for efficient QR code creation and SkiaSharp for high-quality visual rendering, ensuring both performance and visual appeal.
